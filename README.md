# Project-1-My-Resume-
Crafted My Resume Entirely in HTML - Check it Out!
Excited to share that I've built a minimalist and clean resume using pure HTML!  No fancy CSS to distract, just the power of structure and semantic markup to showcase my skills and experience.

I'm curious for your feedback! Take a look at the code in the index.html file and let me know what you think.  I'm open to suggestions on how to improve the accessibility, readability, or even add a touch of visual flair (without straying from HTML, of course!).

This project was a great exercise in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with just one language. It also helped me gain a deeper understanding of HTML's potential for creating clean and effective layouts.

So, whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, I encourage you to check out my HTML resume and share your thoughts!

P.S. Feel free to fork the repo and make it your own! Let's see what creative HTML resumes we can come up with together.
